# About 

The idea is to develop an API for streaming elevation data at arbitrary
locations in Canada... and soon, THE WORLD!


Right now, it's a tool to crawl over a specified area and provide a scanline of
the elevation in that area for further munging.

A separate API call is required for every single elevation point. This is very
slow, and the government webmaster probably doesn't appreciate me slamming his
endpoint without moderation.
